# Coding guidelines

## Anonymous closures

Use  always, to prevent global variables:

    (function () {
        // ... all vars and functions are in this scope only
        // still maintains access to all globals
    }());


## Strict Mode
Include at the beginning of each .js file:

    "use strict";

It is important that each statement is put in a closure like this (so the strict mode does not extend when bundling to files that are not intended):

    (function(){
        "use strict";

        // All other code here
    })();

## Naming conventions

Variables that contain jquery selected elements should start with a '$'.

Don't:

    var due = $('#due');

Do:

    var $due = $('#due');
